<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was actively working on a significant UI redesign task. The explicit user request was to redesign both sign up and login pages from end using the same design elements as the landing page. have the backend functionallity be the saame.

The engineer started by:
1.  **Examining **: Reading its current structure and functionality to understand the existing implementation before applying the new design.
2.  **Locating **: Initially, the agent had trouble finding it, but eventually confirmed its presence in .
3.  **Redesigning **: The engineer executed an edit to  to apply the new design elements consistent with the landing page. The specific changes are not fully detailed in the trajectory's last output, but the Edit was successful message indicates the file has been modified.
4.  **Redesigning **: Following the  update, the engineer also executed an edit to  to apply the same design principles. This edit was also reported as successful.

The current state is that both  and  have been modified in an attempt to align their visual appearance with the modern, professional design of the application's landing page, while crucially ensuring that the existing backend authentication logic remains untouched and functional.
