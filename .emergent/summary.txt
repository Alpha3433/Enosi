The previous AI engineer effectively transitioned the wedding marketplace MVP from  status to a near-launch state, primarily focusing on critical bug fixes and significant UI/UX enhancements. Initially, the core task was to resolve a critical frontend authentication issue related to JWT token storage. The engineer systematically debugged this by examining relevant frontend files, testing backend APIs to isolate the problem to the frontend, and then using web search to find a suitable fix. This led to replacing a faulty  library with a native  solution. Post-authentication fix, the focus shifted entirely to a comprehensive UI redesign, specifically revamping the landing page and search results page. This involved multiple iterations of component restructuring, adapting provided HTML/CSS into React components, and meticulously aligning the design with visual mockups and detailed MD specifications, including consistent typography and layout. The engineer followed a methodical approach: understand, plan, execute (often rewriting components), and verify.

<product_requirements>
The core product is a wedding marketplace MVP.
**Problem:** A critical authentication issue (JWT token not stored correctly on the frontend) was blocking access to protected features (customer planning tools, vendor dashboard, messaging). The initial goal was to fix this quickly.
**Implemented Features (before current work):**
*   **Core Vendor Discovery:** Vendor search with category filters, vendor detail pages with galleries, ratings/reviews display, Request Quote CTAs.
*   **Landing Page & Branding:** Professional Airbnb-style design, hero section with search, feature showcases, mobile responsive.
*   **Backend Infrastructure:** Complete API endpoints, MongoDB integration, Stream Chat integration, Admin approval system.
*   **Security & Access Control:** Route protection, role-based access control, JWT authentication backend.
**Requested Fixes/Enhancements during the trajectory:**
1.  **Fix Authentication Issue:** Resolve the JWT token not being stored properly in  and .
2.  **Redesign Frontend (Landing Page):** Match a provided Airbnb-style screenshot, including header, hero section, 4-field search form, popular wedding destinations, hotels loved by guests, newsletter section, and footer.
3.  **Revamp Landing Page (Second Iteration):** Implement a provided HTML/CSS structure as a React component, ensuring a modern layout with an overlay search bar and sophisticated grid system. This included updating fonts (Lato, Open Sans, Material Icons) and color schemes.
4.  **Adjust White Landing Page Search Bar:** Move it out of the image, give it a clean, rounded, overlapping container with a soft drop shadow, rounded corners for fields, labels above inputs, appropriate icons, a full-width circular blue search button, and slight spacing.
5.  **Adjust Hotels loved by guests Section:** Match a specific attached image and provided React component code for card designs.
6.  **Update Overall Design (Third Iteration):**
    *   **Destination Cards:** Replace Sydney image, match 6-card grid layout with soft rounded corners and padding.
    *   **Hotels Section:** Match layout and design of hotel cards (rounded, city name, top-left rating, price text).
    *   **Footer:** Add newsletter signup block and update font, spacing, and layout.
7.  **Text Alignment & Font Family:** Move Popular Wedding destinations and Hotels loved by guests headings to the left, and change the entire application's font family to Prompt.
8.  **Replace Search Results Page:** Implement provided HTML/CSS for a search results page as a React component, making it dynamic for wedding vendors (not hotels), and ensuring the Prompt font family.
9.  **Integrate Landing Page Search Bar with Search Results:** Redirect to the new search results page with parameters upon valid search, and prompt users for missing fields if validation fails.
10. **Refine Search Results Page Search Bar:** Make it more compact, add subtle grey outlines/shadows to inputs, use labels above inputs with icons, make the search button full-width and height-aligned, and add spacing.
11. **General Search Results Page Improvements:** Remove cluttered bullet-style values in the top-left search preview, replace with a clean summary, and use consistent padding/font sizes.

**Directory Structure:**


**Key Files and Changes:**

*   **/app/backend/server.py**: Main FastAPI application. The backend authentication API was confirmed to be working correctly. No direct code changes were observed in the trajectory for this file, though backend logs were checked.

        *   Displaying search results dynamically with vendor details (image, name, type, location, features, pricing, rating).
        *   Ensuring dynamic display of search parameters in the header (e.g., 4 results for: Melbourne, Jan 21, Photographer, 50 guests).
        *   The problematic  hook was removed, and static mock data was used temporarily.
        *   Further refinements were made to the left sidebar's search bar for compactness, input field styling (outlines/shadows, labels above inputs, icons), and the full-width search button.

<pending_tasks>
- The  hook in  was temporarily removed and replaced with static mock data. Re-integrating dynamic data fetching for vendors is a pending task.
- The  issue in the backend logs needs to be addressed.
- Implement the View vendor details action on vendor cards on the search results page to link to individual vendor pages (this was mentioned as an action button, but the implementation detail for actual navigation to a dynamic page is not complete).
</pending_tasks>

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was focused on refining the design and functionality of the **wedding search results page ()**.

The specific tasks being addressed were:
1.  **Refining the white search bar on the left sidebar**:
    *   **Goal:** Make it match the design and structure from a provided Search results.jpeg image, making it more compact and proportional.
    *   **Specific changes:**
        *   Reduced the size of input fields and made the overall form more compact.
        *   Added subtle grey outlines or soft shadowing to each input for clarity.
        *   Implemented a modern field structure with labels directly above inputs.
        *   Added appropriate icons next to each field (e.g., calendar for date, user for guests).
        *   Made the blue search button full-width and height-aligned to the inputs.
        *   Added slight spacing between filters.
2.  **General Improvements to the main content area**:
    *   **Goal:** Remove cluttered bullet-style values in the top-left search preview.
    *   **Specific changes:** Replace with a clean summary like 4 results for: Melbourne, Jan 21, Photographer, 50 guests.
    *   **Consistency:** Ensure consistent padding, font sizes, and input shapes across the page for a modern, clean look, mirroring the hotel version.

The last completed action was Edit was successful after updating the filter sections to have better spacing and modern styling. The engineer was then about to update the vendor cards to have more consistent modern styling.
