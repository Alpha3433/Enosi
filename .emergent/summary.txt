The previous AI engineer successfully brought the wedding marketplace application from an MVP state to a more robust and feature-rich product. The initial phase focused on critical bug fixes, including resolving a JWT authentication issue by transitioning to  for token management and addressing a  backend dependency error. Following stabilization, extensive UI/UX enhancements were undertaken, notably a major redesign of  and  to align with detailed mockups, leveraging Tailwind CSS and a new earth-tone color scheme. Numerous new pages like , , , and  were created and seamlessly integrated. Recent efforts concentrated on implementing site-wide 90% scaling, incorporating a heart-save feature for vendor cards, redesigning the newsletter signup, enhancing the search bar with auto-suggestions, and integrating micro-interactions/animations across the frontend. The engineer also addressed a persistent JSX syntax error in . Critically, the engineer ensured data persistence and dynamic updates for planning tools (Budget, Guest List, Checklist) using  and began implementing a comprehensive, dynamic notification system, showcasing a systematic approach to debugging and complex feature implementation.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was actively working on two main issues and had just completed the fixes for the first two:
1.  **Budget Planner Edit/Delete Functionality:** The user reported that the edit and delete buttons on budget categories within the  were non-functional. The AI engineer successfully implemented the  and  functions, ensuring that budget items are correctly modified and removed, and that these changes persist in . Confirmation dialogs were also added for deletions.
2.  **Dynamic Notification System:** The user requested a comprehensive, dynamic, and interactive notification system. The AI engineer has successfully:
    *   Created  to manage user-specific notifications with  persistence and automatic cleanup.
    *   Developed  to display notifications, including a bell icon with unread count, and functionality to mark as read/unread or delete.
    *   Integrated the  into  for global availability.
    *   Integrated the  into , adding logic for demo notifications and real-time updates based on user actions.
    *   Updated  to trigger vendor saved notifications when users click the heart icon.
    *   The system supports various notification types (quotes, messages, bookings, reminders, tasks, saved vendors) with priority-based styling and smooth animations.

The very last explicit request from the user (Chat Message 391) was: nothing happens when i click the notifications icon on any other page besides the dashboard page. once a couple or vendor login, have the notifications icon always be visible. The AI engineer acknowledged this and has *just started* working on it, beginning with examining  to integrate the  into it. The current state is that the Budget Planner edit/delete and the core notification system are implemented, and the work to make notifications visible and interactive on all relevant pages is ongoing, with  being the current focus.

<optional_next_step>
Integrate the  component into  and other relevant planning pages to ensure the notification icon is always visible and interactive.
