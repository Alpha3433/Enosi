          comment: "Successfully tested the complete authentication flow. The login page loads correctly and allows users to enter credentials. Upon successful login, the auth_token and user_data cookies are properly set using the native document.cookie functions. The token is correctly included in API requests as an Authorization Bearer header. Protected routes like /dashboard, /planning/budget, and /planning/checklist are accessible after login and display their content correctly. When logging out or clearing cookies, protected routes correctly redirect to the login page. The session persists after page refresh, with the user remaining logged in and able to access protected routes. Despite some JavaScript console errors related to the 'match' property, they don't prevent the authentication flow from functioning properly."

Testing confirmed that users can now type multiple characters continuously without losing focus in various input fields. Character-by-character typing tests were performed on multiple fields including text inputs and textareas, and all maintained focus properly throughout the typing process.

The problem is that the js-cookie library is not available in the frontend application, despite being imported in the AuthContext.js file. When testing cookie functionality, I found that regular cookies can be set using document.cookie, but the js-cookie library functions (Cookies.set and Cookies.get) are not available. This is why the login function in AuthContext.js fails to store the authentication token and user data in cookies. The SimpleRegistrationTest.js component successfully registers users and receives valid tokens from the backend API, but the main login flow fails because it relies on the js-cookie library to store the token. The solution is to either ensure js-cookie is properly imported and available in the application, or modify the AuthContext.js file to use document.cookie directly instead of relying on the js-cookie library."
